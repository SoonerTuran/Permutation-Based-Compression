# Permutation-Based Compression Project

This C# project utilizes a permutation-based algorithm to compress and decompress files of various types. The objective is to explore an alternative method in data compression, offering both compression and decompression functionalities along with supporting transformation methods for efficient data handling.

## Note

The compression ratio may appear lower due to the manner in which data is read. Reading data as a Byte Array can lead to the loss of repetitions within the data, which in turn may decrease efficiency. This project aims to explore the permutation-based approach despite this characteristic, focusing on the method's potential in different data handling scenarios.
